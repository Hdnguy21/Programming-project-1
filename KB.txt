# KNOWLEDGE BASE (KB) ANNOTATION
# ==============================
# This KB represents the agent's beliefs about the 4x4 Wumpus World.
# Initial state: only (1,1) is known to be SAFE; all others are UNKNOWN.
#
# Inference Rules Implemented:
# 1. If a cell has NO BREEZE, then all adjacent cells are SAFE from pits.
# 2. If a cell has NO STENCH, then all adjacent cells are SAFE from Wumpus.
# 3. If a cell has a BREEZE, then at least one adjacent unvisited cell contains a pit.
#    → Probability of pit in each candidate = 1 / (number of possible adjacent cells)
# 4. Similarly for STENCH → Wumpus probability.
# 5. Similarly for GLOW → Paradise probability.
# 6. Probabilities are updated only if new evidence increases them.
# 7. A cell is marked SAFE if it is confirmed pit/Wumpus-free by rule (1) or (2).
#
# Representation per cell:
# - SAFE: known to be free of danger
# - UNKNOWN: no conclusive evidence
# - Breeze/Stench/Glow: percept observed when agent visited that cell
# - p_pit, p_wumpus, p_paradise: estimated probabilities (0.0 to 1.0)
